# AndroidPMS - Software Project 2


1. Please make sure that you have running the pms-db (which is the REST API used by the application) before you test the app.
2. After downloading the zip file from github, import the project into android studio.
3. In order to test the app you have to first create a virtual device. To do that go to: Tools > AVD Manager, and set up a new device
that with API Level 27 and Android 8.1 Oreo.
4. After that you should be able to run the project on your newly created virtuak device.
